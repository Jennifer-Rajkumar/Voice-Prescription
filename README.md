# Voice-Prescription
A web application where the doctor prescribes the medicine through voice. The audio is converted into text and is allowed to edit if there is any mistake. Then the text is converted into pdf prescription and digital signature of the doctor is attached. Then the pdf is sent to the patient's mail and is also stored for future reference. It also recommends the drugs or medications for a diagnosed disease.
